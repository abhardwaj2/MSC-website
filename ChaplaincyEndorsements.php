    <p id="endorsement">[T]he Intensive Journal method and Progoff's embodiment of his holistic depth psychology in the Intensive Journal process have been my major theoretical and structural approach to awareness, life, and ministry. As a priest, chaplain, and minister, I have found that the method can provide a comprehensive approach for bringing my life together...and providing strategies for working through relationships, meaning in life, and depth experiences. I particularly recommend the Intensive Journal method for all involved in ministry and human services.</p>

    <p id="endorsement">"The skills I learned in Intensive Journal workshops served me invaluably as a hospital chaplain. I found myself more able to name and address the unaddressable in the midst of the thick of life. In my reflective time, I used the method to "find voice for that which speaks as 'deep to deep.'" </p>

    <p id="endorsement">     "This [Intensive Journal] program was very helpful in establishing a reflective mind set in my students and in providing them a conceptual framework for organizing their journal writing. The workshop affected a more uniform reflective style of writing [and] this carried over into their participation in clinical and peer group process seminars. The Intensive Journal workshop provided a strong start for the CPE program."</p>
